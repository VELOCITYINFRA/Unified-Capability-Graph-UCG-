Unified Capability Graph (UCG), a system for services that maps every API, tool, and AI agent as nodes in a single, continuously evolving graph. Instead of relying on humans to search for, wire, and maintain integrations, AI agents reason through this graph to determine the exact sequence of actions required to complete a task across chains and domains.
